						<dt id="description">What is hReader?</dt>
						<dd>
							hReader is a patient-centric, simple, safe, mobile health data manager that 
							provides patients and their families with their complete health information 
							in the palm of their hand.  It leverages the
							<a href="http://www.projecthdata.org">hData</a> and
							<a href="http://wiki.siframework.org/RHEx">RHEx</a> projects, 
							and provides an applet framework to provide hyper-personalized 
							“focused-on-me” applets to engage patients in their own health status and 
							how they can improve.  hReader will be released to the open source community 
							and available for free.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="need">Why do we need hReader?</dt>
						<dd>
							Today, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for patients and families
							to obtain their complete health information.  Patients and families 
							often see many different providers and specialists and that data is owned 
							and scattered across those providers.  Many patients today have little or no 
							access to this health care data.  When it is made available to the patient, 
							it is spread across a variety of portals and often difficult to understand.  
							Patient-provider communication is also very sporadic and inconsistent.  All 
							of these factors makes it very difficult to engage patients to improve their 
							health, which results in increased office visits and higher cost.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="objective">What is the objective of hReader?</dt>
						<dd>
							The desired outcome for hReader is to securely collect and capture the 
							patient’s entire health care record to make it easy for them to understand 
							and correct, if necessary.  By helping patients understand their individual 
							health data and their family’s health status, and by providing a mobile 
							platform to access that data, hReader seeks to improve the communication 
							between patients, family members, and health care providers.  This should 
							engage and empower patients to improve their health access protocols, 
							security, and vision, with better results at a lower cost.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="users">Who are the intended users of hReader?</dt>
						<dd>
							Patients and families.
						</dd>
						<dt id="funding">Who is funding the hReader project?</dt>
						<dd>
							The hReader project is currently being funded by 
							<a href="http://www.mitre.org">the MITRE corporation</a>.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="meaningful_use">Can hReader be used to demonstrate Meaningful Use?</dt>
						<dd>
							Stage 2 Meaningful Requirements mandates that information on allergies,
							adverse reactions, alerts, medications, problems, procedures, and results
							be reported.  hReader provides this information in the summary, conditions, 
							and timeline pages.  hReader also provides information that is optional in
							Stage 2, including encounters, functional status, immunizations, plan of
							care, and vital signs.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="human_factors">Does hReader have human factors specialists on the team?</dt>
						<dd>
							Yes, hReader has human factors specialists on the team. Human factors 
							is a multidisciplinary field that concerns the study of how people 
							interact with technological systems. Human factors practitioners consider 
							the physical settings, cognitive and perceptual capabilities of the user, 
							the organizational climate and how these factors interact with technology. 
							The primary goal is to understand the user and develop technology that 
							enhances what people do well and provide support for those tasks that 
							people find difficult. Human factors has important implications for health 
							care systems, so human factors experts apply their knowledge of human 
							computer interaction, usability, and user interface design to improve the 
							usability of the hReader software.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="operations">What is the basic theory of operations for use of hReader?</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								hReader works in conjunction with the 
								<a href="http://wiki.siframework.org/RHEx">RESTful Health Exchange</a> 
								project (RHEx) Patient Data Server to provide patients with their data.  
								RHEx interfaces with a variety of different EHR systems and acts as a 
								secure repository for patient data.  
								<a href="http://wiki.siframework.org/RHEx">RHEx</a> also provides a 
								single RESTful API, which hReader uses to access the data.
							</p>
							<img src="images/rhex.png" />
							<p class="after-rhex">
								Once the patient's data is downloaded to hReader in greenCDA JSON format, 
								it is encrypted (if the pass code has been set) and stored on the iPad so 
								that it can be accessed even without a network connection.  Local iPad
								storage allows the patient to control their own data, bring it to
								their provider, and ask more informed questions about their health.
							</p>
							<p>
								If a network connection is available, real-time updates are possible
								between RHEx and hReader.
							</p>
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="standards">What standards does hReader use?</dt>
						<dd>
							hReader make use of several emerging standards, both directly and 
							indirectly, including
							<a href="http://projecthdata.org">hData</a>
							and the
							<a href="http://wiki.siframework.org/RHEx">RHEx Patient Data Server</a>.  
							Soon, it will also integrate with standards established by the
							<a href="http://projectpophealth.org">popHealth</a> project.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="instructions">Are there step-by-step instructions for setting up hReader from source code?</dt>
						<dd>
							Yes.  This information will be made available when the code is released.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="ios">Does hReader run under iOS?</dt>
						<dd>
							Yes.  It currently runs only on the iPad, including the original iPad,
							iPad 2, and the new iPad.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="iphone">Does hReader run on an iPhone or iPod Touch?</dt>

						<dt id="blackberry">Does hReader run under Blackberry?</dt>
						<dd>
							No.  There are no plans to develop hReader for Blackberry.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="languages">What programming languages does hReader use?</dt>
						<dd>
							hReader runs on Apples iOS application framework. Developing new software 
							with hReader, and/or adding new customized features, will require 
							non-trivial software development knowledge of iOS, Objective C, or 
							HTML5/CSS3 programming languages.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="license">Under what license is hReader released?</dt>
						<dd>

							</p>
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="communication">How is communication managed on the open source project?</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								The most prominent and active activities are always published on the 
								project website. We have attempted to include enough high level 
								information on our project site and our installation instructions 
								available in the source code to setup the development environment for 
								hReader. Whenever possible, please make use of our FAQ and software 
								documentation before exploring other communication channels.
							</p>
